# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Warn and fail findings for `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND`, `UNPINNED_PACKAGE`, `BAD_URL`, `BAD_URL_PROTOCOL`, `PLACEHOLDER_ENV`, `PLACEHOLDER_HEADER`, `ENV_FILE_MISSING`, `NO_TRANSPORT`, and `MISSING_TRANSPORT_TYPE` include one copy-paste fix. Human output prints that sentence under the finding. JSON adds `hint` and keeps the other finding fields. SARIF and GitHub annotations include the same sentence. The fix names the command, package argument, or field and does not include secret values. The config file is not rewritten. There is no `--fix` flag (#88).
- Discover Google Antigravity project `.agents/mcp_config.json` and user `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` (#96). `--no-user` skips the user file. A missing file is skipped, not `FILE_NOT_FOUND`. `mcpServers` uses the existing parser: `command` and `args` are stdio, and `serverUrl` or `url` is a remote URL. A file with no `mcpServers` key is skipped. `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` still selects Gemini CLI `.gemini/settings.json` and does not move the Antigravity file. The config file is not rewritten.

### Fixed

- `--probe` on `http:` and `https:` keeps `Mcp-Session-Id` from initialize and sends it on the later requests in that probe, including the initialized notification and `tools/list`. A successful `server/discover` fallback uses the session id from that response instead. A server that requires the header is `TOOLS_OK` instead of `TOOLS_LIST_FAILED`. A server that does not mint a session id is unchanged. The session id is not printed. A failed handshake still fails. The config file is not rewritten (#94).
- `--online` looks up `uvx` packages on PyPI (`info.version`), not the npm registry. The project name is the distribution: `pkg==1.2.3`, `pkg>=1`, and extras are not part of the URL. An exact pin that matches latest is `NPM_CURRENT`. A pin that does not include latest is `NPM_DRIFT`. An unpinned package is `NPM_LATEST`. Those messages name PyPI. A miss, a network failure, or a timeout is `NPM_LOOKUP_FAILED` and names PyPI. `npx`, `bunx`, `pnpm`, and `yarn` still use npm. The config file is not rewritten (#95).
- Claude Code does not load `mcpServers` from `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, or `~/.claude/settings.json`. A present key is `MCP_SERVERS_IGNORED` (a failure) instead of a healthy server. Project servers belong in `.mcp.json`. User servers belong in `~/.claude.json`. A settings file with no `mcpServers` key is still skipped. The entries are not probed. A config-level failure that is not a server row explains exit 2 in the summary (#85).
- VS Code (`.vscode/mcp.json` and the user `mcp.json`), Copilot user `mcp-config.json`, Gemini CLI, and Codex use stdio `cwd` for relative command lookup and for `--probe`. A relative `cwd` is resolved from the scan root. `${workspaceFolder}` and the other config variables are expanded first. An omitted `cwd` stays the scan root. A value that still contains `${…}` does not change the directory. Other clients ignore `cwd`. The config file is not rewritten (#86).
- A script argument for `node`, `python`, `python3`, `bun`, `deno`, or `tsx`, including the `.exe` and `.cmd` names, that is not a file in that directory is `SCRIPT_NOT_FOUND`. The file is not read. `node -e`, `node --version`, `python -m`, and package-runner arguments stay as they are. `bun run dev` is a package script. `bun run src/index.ts` is a file (#86).
- Codex user config follows `CODEX_HOME`. A non-empty value reads `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`. An unset or blank value stays `~/.codex/config.toml`. `--no-user` skips that file either way. A missing file is skipped, not `FILE_NOT_FOUND`. Project `.codex/config.toml` is unchanged (#87).
- The GitHub Action appends `args` after `--no-user`. Setting `args` to `--probe` or `--online` no longer drops `--no-user`. `include-user: true` scans the runner's user-level configs. Workflows that set `args` in order to read those configs need `include-user: true`. Passing `--no-user` inside `args` still skips them. Annotations, SARIF, and `fail-on-missing` are unchanged (#89).
- A `uvx` requirement is a pin. `name==1.2.3`, `name[extra]==1.2.3`, and `name>=1.0.0,<2.0.0` are not `UNPINNED_PACKAGE`. `~=1.4.2` is the compatible release `>=1.4.2 <1.5.0`. `name==latest`, `name==next`, and `name==*` stay unpinned. `npx` `name@version` is unchanged (#93).

## [1.5.0] - 2026-10-22

### Added

- Discover GitHub Copilot's committed `.github/mcp.json` (#68). Project scans, including `--no-user`, read it. A missing file is skipped, not `FILE_NOT_FOUND`. A `mcpServers` object uses the existing parser. A bare top-level object is a server map: `command` and `args` are stdio, `url` is HTTP, `type: "local"` still uses `command` and `args`, and `tools` is an allowlist, not a transport.

### Fixed

- VS Code (`.vscode/mcp.json` and the user `mcp.json`) appends a stdio server's `env.PATH` after the process PATH, and `--probe` spawns with that appended PATH. Other clients still replace PATH (#81).
- `ws:`, `wss:`, `unix:`, and `pipe:` MCP URLs are not `BAD_URL_PROTOCOL`. A fragment subpath such as `unix:///tmp/server.sock#/mcp/subpath` is part of that URL. `ftp:` and `file:` still fail. A URL that still contains `${…}` is unchanged.
- `--probe` does not POST a `ws:`, `wss:`, `unix:`, or `pipe:` URL. Those are `PROBE_SKIPPED`. `http:` and `https:` probes are unchanged.
- A VS Code `servers` env value may be a number or null. A number is checked as its decimal string. Null omits the variable. A boolean or object is still `SCHEMA_ERROR`. Other clients still reject a non-string env value.
- Cursor and VS Code stdio `envFile` warns `ENV_FILE_MISSING` when the expanded path is not a file. The file is not read. `.mcp.json` and `.github/mcp.json` do not warn.
- Expand Claude Code `${VAR}` and `${VAR:-default}` in command, args, env, url, and headers, and expand `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` to the scan root. An unset `${VAR}` with no default is a warning, the same as an unset `${env:NAME}`. A URL that still contains `${…}` is not also `BAD_URL`. Expanded values are not printed.
- `name@latest`, `name@next`, and `name@*` are `UNPINNED_PACKAGE`. `--online` reports `NPM_LATEST` for those tags instead of calling them pinned. Exact versions and semver ranges stay pinned.
- Stdio command lookup uses the server's `env.PATH` when that value has no unresolved `${…}`. The probe spawns the absolute path found there. On Windows, `Path` is the same key. A PATH that still contains `${…}` stays on the variable check.
- Gemini CLI `httpUrl` is a remote URL. It wins over `url` and `command`.
- Doc placeholders in env, headers, and Cursor `auth` warn (`PLACEHOLDER_ENV`, `PLACEHOLDER_HEADER`).
- An unset Gemini CLI `$NAME` env reference warns `UNRESOLVED_VARIABLE`. On Windows, `%NAME%` does too. A set value is not printed.
- Claude Code `.mcp.json` and `~/.claude.json`: a `url` with no `type` is `MISSING_TRANSPORT_TYPE`. `type: "sdk"` is skipped instead of `NO_TRANSPORT`.

### Changed

- The install examples run `check --no-user`. Omitting the flag also reads user-level configs, and those rows are labeled `user`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-10-17

### Added

- Discover Gemini CLI project `.gemini/settings.json` and user `~/.gemini/settings.json`. `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` selects `$GEMINI_CLI_HOME/.gemini/settings.json`. `mcpServers` uses the existing parser. A settings file with no `mcpServers` key is skipped. `--no-user` skips the user file. System settings are not scanned.
- Discover the VS Code user `mcp.json` (`servers`) and the Copilot user `mcp-config.json` (`mcpServers`). VS Code uses `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/mcp.json` on macOS, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Code/User/mcp.json` (default `~/.config/Code/User/mcp.json`) on Linux, and `%APPDATA%/Code/User/mcp.json` on Windows. `COPILOT_HOME` replaces `~/.copilot`. `--no-user` skips both. A missing file is skipped. Insiders and VSCodium are not scanned.
- Warn `UNPINNED_PACKAGE` when `uvx`, `bunx`, `pnpm dlx`, `pnpm exec`, or `yarn dlx` launches a package without a version. `name@version` and `uvx --from name@version` do not warn. `--online` looks up that same package. A registry miss stays `NPM_LOOKUP_FAILED`.

### Fixed

- Claude Code `projects` keys in `~/.claude.json` match the scan root when both paths are the same directory, including a symlink and macOS `/tmp` versus `/private/tmp`. A key for a different directory is still ignored. Trailing-slash and Windows case matching is unchanged.
- A relative stdio command is resolved from the scan root, and the probe spawns that absolute path. A command that exists only in the process working directory is still `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND`.
- On Windows, a bare command is searched in the scan root before `PATH`, with `PATHEXT`. An empty `PATH` entry is that directory on every platform. An unset `PATH` does not search it.
- SARIF URIs and GitHub annotation `file` paths are relative to the workspace when the scan root is the process working directory or a subdirectory of it. A scan root outside that directory stays relative to itself.

### Changed

- A scan with no MCP config still exits 1. The `NO_CONFIG` message names a project file to add (`.cursor/mcp.json` or `.vscode/mcp.json`) and `--allow-missing` to exit 0 when the repository is supposed to have no MCP config.
- Human-readable server rows say `project` or `user`. JSON keeps the file path and adds `scope`. Summary counts are unchanged.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-10-13

### Added

- Discover Claude Code user and local servers in `~/.claude.json`: top-level `mcpServers`, and `projects[<absolute path>].mcpServers` for the scan root only. Other projects in the file are ignored. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` selects the directory. On Windows the file is `%USERPROFILE%\.claude.json`. `--no-user` skips the file, including the per-project entry. A file with no servers for this root is skipped, not `NO_MCP_SECTION`. Values from the file are not printed.
- Discover Continue `.continue/mcpServers/*.{yaml,yml,json}` and an `mcpServers` list in `.continue/config.yaml` and `~/.continue/config.yaml` (user file skipped with `--no-user`). Each list entry is one server. `command` and `args` are stdio, `url` is HTTP, and neither is `NO_TRANSPORT`. A file with no `mcpServers` list is skipped. A missing `.continue/` directory is not a failure. Unpinned `npx` packages still warn `UNPINNED_PACKAGE`. A JSON object dropped in that directory uses the existing `mcpServers` parser.
- Discover Junie `.junie/mcp/mcp.json` and `~/.junie/mcp/mcp.json` (unless `--no-user`), using the existing `mcpServers` parser. A missing file is skipped.
- Discover Cline `~/.cline/data/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json` unless `--no-user` is set. `CLINE_MCP_SETTINGS_PATH` replaces that file. `CLINE_DATA_DIR` uses `<dir>/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json` when the settings path is unset. A missing file is skipped.

### Changed

- README states that npm `latest` and the `v1` Action tag track 1.2.1, and that `package.json` is 1.3.0 until the `v1.3.0` tag is pushed.
- README shows a monorepo `path`, `fail-on-missing`, a full SARIF upload workflow, and husky, lefthook, and pre-commit snippets.
- README lists Claude Code `~/.claude.json`, Continue, Junie, and Cline, including `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CLINE_MCP_SETTINGS_PATH`, and `CLINE_DATA_DIR`.
- `--no-user` help text names every user-level client it skips, including Continue, Junie, and Cline.

### Fixed

- An empty server map still exits 1, and the summary line says that config-level warning is why. Server counts still add up. `NO_CONFIG` is unchanged.
- `--probe-timeout` must be a positive number of milliseconds. A non-numeric, zero, or negative value exits before a probe starts. The default stays 8000.
- On Windows, the user-level scan includes the Claude Desktop MSIX config `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Packages/Claude_pzs8sxrjxfjjc/LocalCache/Roaming/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` when that file exists, along with `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-10-10

### Fixed

- `${input:…}` and an unset `${env:NAME}` are warnings. Unknown `${…}` tokens still fail. `--strict-variables` fails on the warnings too. A probe is not started while a variable is unresolved.
- Cursor `disabled: true` and Codex or Zed `enabled: false` are reported as disabled and are not checked.
- An HTTP 401 or 403 with an OAuth `WWW-Authenticate` challenge is `PROBE_OAUTH`, a warning. The MCP client signs in. A 401 without that challenge is still a failure.
- JSON configs accept comments and trailing commas.
- Codex `bearer_token_env_var` and `env_http_headers` are sent on probes. A missing variable is `AUTH_ENV_UNSET` and the value is not printed.
- Zed `"source": "extension"` servers are not `NO_TRANSPORT`.
- Relative `-f` paths resolve from the current directory. A missing file is `FILE_NOT_FOUND`. A missing scan root is `ROOT_NOT_FOUND`. HTTP connection failures include the cause, such as `ECONNREFUSED`.
- Summary `ok`, `warn`, and `fail` count servers only, so they add up. Skipped settings files are `skipped`.
- The Action does not fail a job that only has `NO_CONFIG`, unless `fail-on-missing` is true.
- Node.js 22.12 or newer is required, matching commander 15. CI, the release workflow, and the Action default use Node 22.

### Changed

- README and roadmap match the published package, the `v1` tag, and the Marketplace listing.
- The release workflow publishes the current changelog section, requests `id-token: write`, and publishes with provenance. `NPM_TOKEN` remains the fallback when trusted publishing is not configured.
- Workflows use `actions/checkout@v7`, `actions/setup-node@v7`, and `softprops/action-gh-release@v3`. The Action uses `actions/setup-node@v7` and `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v4`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added

- After a successful `--probe` handshake, call `tools/list`. An empty catalog is `EMPTY_TOOLS` (a warning). A tools/list error or timeout is `TOOLS_LIST_FAILED` (a warning). `--no-tools` skips the call. A catalog with at least one tool stays successful.
- Discover Windsurf (`.windsurf/mcp_config.json` and `serverUrl`), Zed (`.zed/settings.json` `context_servers`, including a command object), and Codex (`.codex/config.toml` `[mcp_servers.<name>]`). User-level paths for those clients are included unless `--no-user` is set. A missing file, or a Codex config with no `mcp_servers` table, is not a failure.
- `--sarif <file>` writes SARIF 2.1.0 for warn and fail findings. `--github-annotations` prints `::warning` and `::error` on stderr. The GitHub Action emits annotations and writes `mcp-health.sarif` by default, and uploads that file only when `upload-sarif` is `true`.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-10

### Fixed

- Expand `${workspaceFolder}`, `${userHome}`, `${pathSeparator}`, and `${env:NAME}` in commands, args, URLs, env, and headers. Unresolved `${input:…}` and other `${…}` tokens fail the server instead of reporting it healthy.
- Run stdio probes with the scan root as the working directory, so a config in `.vscode/` can launch a relative path from the project root.
- Fail a stdio probe when the server process exits, instead of waiting out `--probe-timeout`.
- Match stdio and SSE responses by JSON-RPC id. Log lines and notifications are skipped.
- Send HTTP `headers` from the config. 401 and 403 are failures. Streamable HTTP `text/event-stream` bodies are read as the handshake result.
- Advertise protocol `2025-11-25` on initialize. If that method is rejected, try `server/discover` on `2026-07-28`.
- Treat a semver range such as `^2025.1.0` as current when npm latest satisfies it.
- Report `SCHEMA_ERROR` when `mcpServers` is present but invalid (for example a numeric env value), instead of `NO_MCP_SECTION`.
- Omit `OK HEALTHY` when the same server also has a warning or a failure.
- On Windows, resolve commands with `PATHEXT` so `npx.cmd` is not reported missing, and spawn the resolved path.

### Changed

- npm package name is `@leon-pixel/mcp-health`. The unscoped name `mcp-health` was published and then unpublished, and npm will not release it again. The bin name is still `mcp-health`.
- The release workflow publishes that package when `NPM_TOKEN` is set, and it moves the `v1` tag to each stable `v1.x.y` release.
